        <p>hey, it’s been a while. shortly after my first (and last) post, i started working as a mobile developer at TikTok. i’m still there, but i’m gearing up to do a postgraduate degree at ANU focusing on PL theory/formal verification.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">motivation</h2>
<h3 id="why-did-i-start-writing">why did i start writing?</h3>
<p>when i made the blog at the beginning of 2024, i was driven by a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>i was having fun with my side projects and wanted to write about my experiences as a form of documentation, both for my future self and for my career.</li>
<li>it was fun hacking with <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">hakyll</a>, the site generator that i used to create the website.</li>
<li>i had an existential realisation that i had no written record of who i was/had been for a very long time, and i figured one way to start such a record was through a blog.</li>
</ul>
<p>i think it’s pretty easy looking back to see how my drive fell apart quickly. the source of motivation was either bound to be short-lived (shiny new thing) or vague enough that it fell apart the moment it was tested. nevertheless, let’s explore those tests.</p>
<h3 id="why-did-i-stop">why did i stop?</h3>
<p>again, i have a few answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>i don’t have much to offer my (nonexistent) readership in terms of original, interesting content. i know it’s a silly headspace to be in. but generally when i get to writing about some technical project, i have attained enough fluency with what i want to write about to “see” how trivial it is and so find my writing about it to be inane and uninspired.</li>
<li>i find the process of writing to be pretty paralysing. after finishing each sentence, i have a compulsion to go back and edit the wording to something that aesthetically appeals to me. giving into that compulsion leads to me getting stuck and finally convincing myself that i suck at writing (i do, but that’s what gets me to stop in times like these).</li>
<li>like i said at the start, i started a job very shortly after and found myself pretty busy with that. i also had a reasonably involved wrist surgery that kept me from typing too long.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-am-i-back">why am i back?</h3>
<p>in preparation for the postgrad, i’ve worked through 3-ish textbooks without writing a single thought down. i know this now to be the wrong way to approach self-study.</p>
<p>this time around, i have the concrete goal of writing about technical things that i’m currently tackling. we’ll see if the scope expands, but i want to be clear going in that that’s what the blog is about. in this way, i don’t need to worry about my readership’s expectations for “original” content. instead, the focus will be on the clarity of the technical prose, hopefully thereby ironing out my misunderstandings/knowledge gaps.</p>
<p>i’m going to be purposefully light on editing the aesthetic element of the writing. i want to free myself from my expectations.</p>
<p>i also want to lower my idea of what constitutes an interesting enough idea to write about. i’m thinking that maybe i’ll start a devlog-y thing for the current textbook i’m reading.</p>
<p>and about my job, things are still pretty hectic but i’m making do.</p>
<h2 id="what-have-i-been-up-to">what have i been up to?</h2>
<p>so i’ve said already that i read 3-ish textbooks. those were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html">Logical Foundations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html">Programming Language Foundations</a>
<ul>
<li>i finished the above two along with 95% of their exercises. they are such good learning material. having formal theorems, definitions, and proofs being so easily scrutinised and interacted with is so useful.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types and Programming Languages</a>
<ul>
<li>this book has a large crossover with the previous two, covering largely the same content up until around halfway through when more complex type systems are discussed. i didn’t make it much further than the content of PLF before hitting a particularly busy patch of real-life work and losing the motivation to continue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/400716.Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Computation">Introduction to the Theory of Computation</a> (i couldn’t find an official website so linked is the goodreads)
<ul>
<li>i didn’t make it very far with this one either, admittedly. around a quarter of the way through i lost motivation in much the same way i did for TAPL. i do mean to come back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a>
<ul>
<li>i’m working through this now, around 3/4 of the way through. specifically, i’m implementing a mirror image of the book’s implementation in haskell. it gives me much the same feeling PLF and LF did, reading a bit of prose and then hacking away with the concept. it’s been really fun.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>i rewrote the parser that i wrote about in my first blog after reading a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3471874.3472984">very illuminating paper</a> recommended in a reddit comment.</p>
<p>i made a <a href="https://github.com/joshcbrown/caydence">small utility</a> for timing wallpaper changes/notifications early last year according to a pomodoro/repeating cycle. it was a fun and self-contained project for exploring async Rust, which for this use-case was really very ergonomic.</p>
<p>and… not a whole lot else, technically. i mean, look at my github contribution history:</p>
<p><img src="../images/github_contributions.png" /></p>
<p>yikes!</p>
<p>anyway, i hope i manage to stick with this.</p>
